## 2. How to handle these data ?
There are many libraries to handle these kind of data:
  1. Keras (<https://keras.io/>)
  2. Tensorflow (<https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)
  3. cv2 (<https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_image_display/py_image_display.html>)
