# Deep Learning On 2-Dimentional Images

## 1. What is 2-Dimentional image ? 
One type of picture you can come across in real life is the two-dimensional one. The two dimensions depicted are length and width and the objects on the picture are flat.

## 2. How to handle these data ?
There are many libraries in Python to handle these kind of data:
  1. Keras (<https://keras.io/>)
  2. Tensorflow (<https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)
  3. cv2 (<https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_image_display/py_image_display.html>)
  


## 3. How these model work ?

Convolutional Neural Network is a neural network consists of convolutional layer, pooling layer (max pooling or average pooling but max pooling is preferable), fully connected layer and at last a softmax pooling
